# In Python, Modules are simply files with the “. py” extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program.
# In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions that you want to include in your application.
# In order to use Module we have to import it into our program, using 'import' command.
#

import turtle
# import time

turtle.forward(90)         # If u get any error, Type this ---> # noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
turtle.right(250)
turtle.forward(150)
turtle.circle(190)
turtle.done()
# time.sleep(4)

#   OR we can also type above code as

# from turtle import forward, right, left, done
# import time

# forward(90)         # If u get any error, Type this ---> # noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
# right(250)
# forward(150)
#
# done()
# time.sleep(4)


# Doing this way can be useful for using a particular object a lot in the program but the problem is it only imports the things that are specifically listed on the import line.


# Another way to import turtle
# from turtle import *
#
# forward(90)
# right(30)
# circle(90)
# done()
